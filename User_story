1. Identify my objects

I want to build a news feed application that show my users recent news article published by the New York Times, bloomberg, and the Guardian. Using this app, the user can:

- Starts the app and is greeted with a list of options on the menu
- Search an article and is shown the detail of that article
- Then either go back to the menu and search again or exit the app


2. Identity objects' responsibilities (each object is only responsible for one thing)

Api
- validate_key
- custom_error_wrong_key
- newsapi

Article
- source
- author
- title
- description
- url
- urlToImage
- publishedAt
- content

Cli
- user_input
- start
- menu
- index
- index open
- exit

3. Design CLI interface pattern

3.1.

Prompting the user for input: What would you like to do?

Defining the input interface: I accept: article, index, index open, exit

Accepting user input by yielding to a prompt and waiting patiently for the user to press enter. If the user never enters anything, the program will wait at this state forever until the process is otherwise terminated.

Taking the user input and executing the appropriate sub-routine or procedure that represents that feature. If a user enters 'help', the program should print the help instructions.

Once that feature terminates, the program is back at the start of the main loop.

3.2. example (using program loop)

CLI programs have to continue running and accepting input from the user until they are explicitly exited through sending a termination signal to the program by pressing CTRL+C , or by telling the program to quit or exit through some sort of input.
