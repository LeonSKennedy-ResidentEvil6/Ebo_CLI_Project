1. Identify my objects

I want to build a news feed application that show my users recent news article published by over 50,000 different sources large and small. Using this app, the user can:

- Starts the app and is greeted with a list of options on the menu
- Chooses an artile and is shown the detail of that article
- Then either go back to the menu and choose another article or exit the app


2. Identity objects' responsibilities (each object is only responsible for one thing)

Api
- validate_key
- custom_error_wrong_key
- newsapi

Artile
- source
- author
- title
- description
- url
- urlToImage
- publishedAt
- content

Cli
- start
- menu
- user_input
- exit

3. Design interface

validate api key
input api key
return custom error if invalid api key
call class method newsapi on api class
parse response, iterate and scrap returned json files
start the app
puts greeting
ask user for input
display menu
user input
return input detail
user return to the menu
user input again
